The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. This pattern involves a single class, which is responsible for joining functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

Hereâ€™s a basic explanation and example to help you restructure your code using the Adapter Pattern:

Intent
The Adapter Pattern is intended to make two incompatible interfaces compatible by creating a wrapper class that converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

Example Scenario
Suppose you have a legacy system that uses a different interface than your new system. The Adapter Pattern can help you make the new system work with the legacy system without changing the legacy code.

Components
1)Target Interface: The interface that the client expects.
2)Adaptee: The existing interface that needs to be adapted.
3)Adapter: The class that implements the target interface and translates the requests to the Adaptee.
