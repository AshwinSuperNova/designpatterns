Definition
The Interpreter design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. It involves defining a grammatical representation for a language and using this representation to interpret sentences in that language. This pattern is useful when you need to define a syntax for a language and interpret or evaluate statements in that language.

Scenario: Simple Arithmetic Expression Evaluator
Scenario
Imagine you are developing a simple calculator application that needs to evaluate basic arithmetic expressions such as "3 + 5" or "10 - 2 + 3". The application should parse these expressions and compute the result correctly, respecting the order of operations (operator precedence).

To achieve this, you can use the Interpreter design pattern. This pattern will allow you to create a structure where each component of the arithmetic expression (numbers and operators) is represented as an object that can interpret itself. This approach makes it easy to parse and evaluate expressions in a flexible and extensible way.
