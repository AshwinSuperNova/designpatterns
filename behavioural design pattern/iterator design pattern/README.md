Iterator Design Pattern
Definition
The Iterator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows sequential access to elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation. It provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

Scenario: Book Collection Iterator
Imagine you are developing a library application that manages a collection of books. You want to allow users to browse through the books one by one. The Iterator design pattern can help you achieve this by providing a way to iterate over the collection of books without exposing the underlying data structure.
