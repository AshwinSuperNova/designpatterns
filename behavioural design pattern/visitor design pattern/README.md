Definition
The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add further operations to objects without having to modify them. It allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

Scenario: Animal Feeding System
Imagine you have an animal feeding system in a zoo. Different animals need to be fed in different ways, and you want to add new types of feed or feeding routines without modifying the animal classes. The Visitor design pattern can help you achieve this.
