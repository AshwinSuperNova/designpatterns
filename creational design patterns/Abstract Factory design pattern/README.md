Abstract Factory Design Pattern
Introduction
The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates a group of individual factories with a common theme.

Why Use the Abstract Factory Pattern?
The Abstract Factory pattern is useful when:

You need to create families of related objects: The pattern ensures that products created are consistent with each other. For example, in a furniture store, a Victorian chair should go with a Victorian sofa and Victorian coffee table.
You want to abstract the creation process: The client code does not need to know the specific classes it needs to instantiate. It can work with interfaces and abstract classes, making the system more flexible and easier to extend.
You need to make it easy to add new families of products: By creating a new factory, you can add new products without changing existing code.
Scenario: Furniture Store
In our scenario, we have a furniture store that offers two styles of furniture: Modern and Victorian. Each style includes a chair, a sofa, and a coffee table. We want a flexible system that allows us to create these sets of furniture without changing the code that makes the request.

Implementation
We implemented the Abstract Factory pattern in our furniture store using the following components:

Product Interfaces: Define the interface for each type of product (Chair, Sofa, CoffeeTable).
Concrete Products: Implement the product interfaces for each style of furniture (ModernChair, ModernSofa, ModernCoffeeTable, VictorianChair, VictorianSofa, VictorianCoffeeTable).
Factory Interface: Declares methods for creating each type of product (FurnitureFactory).
Concrete Factories: Implement the factory interface to create the specific products (ModernFurnitureFactory, VictorianFurnitureFactory).
Client Code: Uses the factory to create a set of furniture without needing to know the specific classes being instantiated.
index.ts: A Blueprint
The index.ts file demonstrates how to use the Abstract Factory pattern to create sets of furniture. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:


We create instances of ModernFurnitureFactory and VictorianFurnitureFactory.
These instances are passed to the createFurniture function.
The function uses the factories to create and use sets of Modern and Victorian furniture.
Summary
Using the Abstract Factory pattern allows our furniture store to create consistent sets of furniture in different styles without changing the client code. This pattern ensures that the correct types of furniture are created together and makes it easy to add new styles in the future. The index.ts file serves as a blueprint, demonstrating the flexibility and extensibility provided by the Abstract Factory pattern.

By following this structure, you can easily extend the system to include new styles of furniture by adding new concrete factories and product implementations, without modifying the existing client code.
