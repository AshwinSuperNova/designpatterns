Scenario:
Imagine you're a project manager (HouseDirector) overseeing the construction of houses. You have two builders (SmallHouseBuilder and LargeHouseBuilder). Each builder knows how to build a different type of house. You (the director) give them the blueprint (steps) for construction.

You start by instructing the small house builder to construct a house.
The small house builder follows your instructions step by step: building walls, doors, windows, roof, and deciding whether to include a swimming pool.
Once the construction is complete, you check the house and note down its details.
Next, you instruct the large house builder to construct a house.
The large house builder follows the same steps, but since it's a large house, it constructs more walls, doors, and even adds a swimming pool.
You check the large house and note down its details.

By using the Builder pattern, you can easily manage the construction of different types of houses without changing the process or the steps involved. This makes the construction process flexible and easy to manage.
