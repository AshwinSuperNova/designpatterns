Prototype Design Pattern
Introduction
The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.

Why Use the Prototype Pattern?
The Prototype pattern is useful when:

Object Creation is Costly: If the cost of initializing a new object is high, cloning an existing object can be more efficient.
Avoiding Subclassing: The pattern allows you to add and remove objects at runtime without altering the underlying system.
Dynamic Configuration: When objects need to be created dynamically at runtime with configurations that are unknown at compile time.
Scenario: Cloning a Sheep
In this scenario, you are a farmer who wants to clone sheep. You have a sheep named Dolly, and you want to create an exact copy of Dolly, named Mini. Instead of creating a new sheep from scratch, you clone Dolly.

Implementation
We implemented the Prototype pattern in our sheep cloning scenario using the following components:

Prototype Interface (Animal): Defines the method makeCopy that all animals must implement to be clonable.
Concrete Prototype (Sheep): Implements the makeCopy method to return a clone of itself.
Client (PrototypeDemo): Uses the prototype to create new objects by cloning an existing object.
