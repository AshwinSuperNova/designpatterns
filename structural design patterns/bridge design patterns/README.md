The Bridge design pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. This pattern involves an interface that acts as a bridge, which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer classes. Both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting each other.

Real-Life Scenario
Imagine you are developing a graphic application that can draw shapes with various colors. You need to be able to draw shapes like circles, squares, and triangles in multiple colors like red, blue, and green. Instead of creating multiple subclasses for every possible combination of shapes and colors, you can use the Bridge pattern to separate the shape and color into distinct class hierarchies.
