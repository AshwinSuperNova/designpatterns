The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. It helps to split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently.

Scenario: Remote Control and Devices
Imagine you are developing a universal remote control that can control various devices like TVs and Radios. The remote control should be able to turn the devices on and off, and the implementation details for controlling each device might differ. The Bridge design pattern can help you achieve this by separating the abstraction (remote control) from the implementation (devices).
