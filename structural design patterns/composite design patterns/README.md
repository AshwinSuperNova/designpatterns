Definition
The Composite design pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Real-Life Scenario
Consider a graphic design application where you can create simple shapes like circles and squares, and combine these shapes into drawings. Each drawing can itself be part of another drawing. The Composite pattern allows you to treat both simple shapes and complex drawings (compositions of shapes) in the same way.
