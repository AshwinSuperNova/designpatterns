Definition
The Facade design pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides a unified and easy-to-use interface for the clients.

Real-Life Scenario
Imagine a computer system with various subsystems such as power management, BIOS, loading screens, and application management. Each subsystem has its own complex interactions and operations. The Facade pattern can be used to provide a simplified interface to manage the computer's operations like turning it on and off, without the client needing to interact with each subsystem individually.
