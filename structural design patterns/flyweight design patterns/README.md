The Flyweight design pattern allows you to fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects, instead of keeping all the data in each object. This pattern is useful when you need to create a large number of similar objects efficiently.

Real-Life Scenario
Imagine you are developing a system to manage a large number of cars in a police database. Each car has attributes like brand, model, color, license plate number, and owner information. Instead of storing the brand, model, and color for every car object (which would consume a lot of memory), you can use the Flyweight pattern to share these common attributes among cars of the same type.
