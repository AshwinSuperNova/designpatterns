The Proxy design pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is used to create a representative object that controls access to another object, which may be remote, expensive to create, or require secure access.
Scenario
Imagine you are developing a weather application that fetches weather forecasts from an external weather service. Fetching the forecast can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. To optimize this, you can use the Proxy pattern to cache the weather forecast for 24 hours, so repeated requests within this period return the cached data instead of making a new request to the real weather service.
